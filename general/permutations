The number of permutations of n objects taken r at a time is given by the formula:
P(n,r) = n!/(n - r)!

The number of combinations of n objects taken r at a time is given by the formula:
C(n,r) = n!/[r!(n - r)!]


how many permutations are there of two letters from the set {a,b,c}?
P(3,2) = 3!/(3-2)! = 6
The list of all of these are: ab, ba, bc, cb, ac and ca. 

Now we will answer the following question: how many combinations are there of two letters from the set {a,b,c}?

As combinations, ab and ba are regarded as the same. Thus there are only three combinations: ab, ac and bc.
C(3,2) = 3!/[2!(3 - 2)!]
