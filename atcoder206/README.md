problem C
7
3 1 4 1 5 1 1

0  0  {(3:0),}  look at map and substract frequency of 3
1  0  {(1:0),(3:1),} look at map and substract frequency of 1
2  0  {(1:1),(3:1),(4:0),} look at map and substract frequency of 4
3  1  {(1:1),(3:1),(4:1),} look at map and substract frequency of 1 (oh there is other 1 already stored in the map)
4  0  {(1:2),(3:1),(4:1),(5:0),} look at map and substract frequency of 5
5  2  {(1:2),(3:1),(4:1),(5:1),} look at map and substract frequency of 1 (oh there is two 1 already stored in the map)
6  3  {(1:3),(3:1),(4:1),(5:1),} look at map and substract frequency of 1 (oh there is three 1 already stroed in the map)
